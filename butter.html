   <h1>Clarified Butter</h1> 
   <p>Our decadent English muffins are cooked in butter, a great cooking medium with one major drawback-the milk solids in butter burn easily. Clarifying the butter is an easy process that removes the milk solids. Leftover clarified butter can be used lke oil for saut√©ing food. It keeps for a few weeks in a refrigerated covered container.</p>
   Makes about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup/180ml

        <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until completely melted and boiling. Cook until the butter stops sputtering, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Skim the foam from the surface of the butter.</li>
        <li>Line a wire sieve with dampened, wrung-out cheesecloth and place over a medium bowl. Carefully pour the clear, yellow melted butter through the sieve, leaving the milky residue behind in the saucepan. (Discard the residue.) Pour into a small container and cover. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
